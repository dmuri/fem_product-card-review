## FrontendMentor Challenge ðŸ‘‹

Completed FrontendMentor challenge of product card preview component with responsive design.

## About the project

A fairly simple component built with using HTML and CSS. I'm continuing to learn more about the ins and outs of the
silly and weird intricacies of CSS.

## What I've learned

Flexbox and grids continue to impress me of how simple it is to create responsive design when used correctly. I've
learned that setting fixed widths and height can lead to some weird layouts when doing responsive design, and it
generally a good idea to let the flex and grid do those things for you automatically whenever possible.
